	<h3>classifying quadrilaterals</h3>
	<!- Body for topic 1 ->
	<p>A square is defined as a plane figure with four equal sides and four right angles.A rectangle is defined as a plane figure with four straight sides and four right angles, especially one with unequal adjacent sides, in contrast to a square.A kite is defined as a quadrilateral figure having two pairs of equal adjacent sides, symmetrical only about its diagonals.A rhombus is defined as a parallelogram with opposite equal acute angles, opposite equal obtuse angles, and four equal sides.A isosceles trapezoid is defined as a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides and it’s symmetrical.A trapezoid is defined as a quadrilateral with only one pair of parallel sides.</p>

	<h3>use coodinate geomtry to prove a classification</h3>
	<!- Body for topic 2 ->
	<p>you have to find the deistance of all the sides and to do this you must use the distance formula which is d= the sqaure root of (x2 - x1)to the power of two plus (y2 - y1) to the power of two </p>
